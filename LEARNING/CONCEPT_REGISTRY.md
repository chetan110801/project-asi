# CONCEPT REGISTRY — one home per concept
**The no-redundancy enforcer.** Before explaining *anything*, check here. If a concept is listed, **link to its home — don't re-explain**. If it's not, explain it once in the right module, then add it here.

`Status: Living index · System Version: 2.1 · Last updated: 2026-06-22`

> Rule (from [`../INSTRUCTIONS/LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../INSTRUCTIONS/LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md) §5): every concept has exactly **one canonical module**, which lives in one **domain folder**. This table maps **concept → home module (`id` + folder) → one-line pointer**. It does *not* hold the explanation itself (that would be repetition) — it points to it. (Folders for planned modules: see [`00_MAP.md`](00_MAP.md).)

## How to use this table
- **Writing a new module?** For each idea you mention, find its row. Listed → write *"(see [home])"*. Missing → this idea needs a home; either it belongs in the module you're writing (add the row, pointing here) or it needs its own module (insert one — [`LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../INSTRUCTIONS/LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md) §8).
- **`id` is stable** even if the file is renumbered, so these pointers survive reordering.
- Rows are added the moment a concept gets its canonical explanation — never before (no empty promises), but planned homes may be pre-listed as ⬜ to reserve the slot.
